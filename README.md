# README

I'm using the https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/ruby-on-rails example instead of the one given on the tutorial as I found it easier to use

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
